## Inspiration
The ultimate dream for many is to meet your heroes, and LeBron is one of the biggest.

## What it does
Immersive chatbot to speak with LeBron James, as well as news articles and clips to keep up with the GOAT.

## How we built it
Used Twitter API to collect a large corpus of LeBron's tweets (@KingJames). Then, we fine-tuned a GPT-4o model to learn the texting style and personality of LeBron, using LangChain and connecting it with a React frontend to create an immersive experience with the GOAT.

## Challenges we ran into
At first, the LeBron AI was not very accurate, and often had hallucinations. This was solved as we fine-tuned a GPT4o agent using over 700 tweets.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Making an immersive LeBron chat simulation.

## What we learned
How to fine-tune agents using OpenAI, and create LLM chains with LangChain.

## What's next for LeBronGPT
More people. Entire Lakers team even.
